## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(50, 70%, 50%) converted to RGB hex value: #BD991F. It is inspired by the concept of community support and is warm and inviting.
- Background color: HSL(50, 20%, 95%) converted to RGB hex value: #F9F7F0. A light background is well-suited to community applications with a light tone, and it creates excellent contrast.
- Accent color: HSL(20, 90%, 40%) converted to RGB hex value: #BF3F0A. This accent adds contrast while keeping with the theme.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, is selected because it is suitable for headlines and body text.
- Simple, outlined icons that represent different skills (e.g., a chef's hat for cooking, a musical note for music lessons).
- Clean, grid-based layout with clear sections for user profiles, skill listings, and booking options.
- Subtle animations for new matches and booking confirmations to enhance user experience.
